# pixel

This is a single file object oriented library to more easily 
create fast graphical c++ applications that abstracts the 
creation of windows and makes using opengl much easier.

It is currently only available for windows, as it uses the
WINAPI to create windows and interact with the user, but linux
and macos support may come in the future.

README will be updated soon.
