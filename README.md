# The pixel Library

This is a single file object oriented library to more easily 
create fast graphical c++ applications that abstracts the 
creation of windows and makes using opengl much easier.

# Compiling

This repository contains the pixel.hpp header file, which should
be the only thing needed, as it is a single file solution.
The 'opengl32.lib' and 'gdiplus.lib' files must be added
to your linker's input for it to link properly.

Additionally, a visual studio solution is provided with some
demos to test the library's functionality, to use them simply
open the solution on Visual Studio and select the proper demo
file by editing it's properties and making it a 'C/C++ source
file".
